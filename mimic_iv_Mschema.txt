# Table: d_items, The d_items table defines clinical item metadata used in event data tables. Each row represents a unique clinical item, identified by itemid, with descriptive labels and abbreviations. The table specifies which event table (linksto) contains the item's recorded values. It does not store metric values or time-based data, but serves as a reference for interpreting event records across various clinical dimensions.
